# Prolog-Assigment
### A prolog assigment for analyzing soccer teams.

## Project Details
That's a project I've created as a university homework for the course, CMPE 260 - Principles of Programming Languages on April 22nd, 2018.

What the project is about can be found via [Project.pdf](https://github.com/corupta/Prolog-Assigment/blob/master/Project.pdf)

## How to Run
* Open a terminal in the same location (folder path) as the project files.
* Make sure the current path includes the files, “cl_base.pl” and “predicates.pl”
* Run the prolog interpreter by typing `gprolog` for Gnu Prolog or `swipl` for SWI-Prolog.
* Load the database by typing `[cl_base].` (Or any alternative database)
* Load the predicates by typing `[predicates].`
* Type any of the predicates (described below) to make queries. 
Alternatively (on windows), run the gnu prolog application, then use `change_directory('path/to/prolog/project').` command. After that load the databases as described above. Instead of using bracket-syntax to load databases, the following commands can also be used: `consult('path/to/prolog/proeject/cl_base.pl').` (or any alternative database) and `consult('path/to/prolog/proeject/predicates.pl').`

## How to Terminate
In order to terminate the program, either close the terminal or press `ctrl + d` . Alternatively,
send interrupt signal by pressing `alt + ctrl + c` on Windows, or `ctrl + c` on Linux; then,
press `e` to exit.
